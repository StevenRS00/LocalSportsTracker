          <h6>A Passion Project</h6>
          <p>This project was assigned to us as a kind of choose your own adventure project.
            We were tasked with finding an idea that we felt passionate about and coding it up.
            We decided to work on and code up Local Sports Tracker to help make Sports enthusiasts
            be able to find sporting events near them. Whether it is little league games and you
            want to support their teams, maybe you want to join a simple pickup game at a nearby
            park, or maybe you are the one wanting to host that game, Local Sports Tracker will
            help you be able to access all of the nearby events. That way you can have fun and
            enjoy life!
